### Customizing your Hoop
You can add, remove, and reorganize patterns on your hoop, change its configuration, and edit playlists from almost any computer without special software.To access the hoop, connect it using a micro USB cable.  The port is located on the side of the hoop, opposite the connector button.  The hoop shows up as a mass storage device, like a USB flash drive.Patterns are stored as BMP image files.  See below for detailed instructions on creating and editing patterns.  The pre-loaded patterns are grouped into folders, and the ‘next folder’ remote button will skip from one folder to another.  You can create new folders or reorganize the existing ones to change the grouping.  Note that only one level of folders is read by the hoop; sub-folders will be ignored.
